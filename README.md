# SQL Problems Solutions

Welcome to the **SQL Problems Solutions** repository! üöÄ  
Here, you'll find my solutions to SQL problems from various popular platforms, including **LeetCode**, **pgexercises**, and **DataLemur**.  

This repository aims to provide reference solutions for those looking to improve their SQL skills or explore different problem-solving approaches. For **LeetCode** problems, I have included both **SQL** and **Pandas** solutions for added variety.

## üìö Platforms Covered:
- **LeetCode**: SQL and Pandas solutions for the problems.
- **pgexercises**: Focuses on core SQL problems for practice.
- **DataLemur**: Problems from this platform are solved using SQL.

## üí° Why Use This Repository?
- **Reference**: Easily refer to solutions for commonly asked SQL problems across popular websites.
- **SQL + Pandas**: For LeetCode problems, I provide solutions in both **SQL** and **Pandas**, allowing you to explore solutions in different paradigms.
- **Problem-Solving Insight**: You can track the number and types of problems I‚Äôm capable of solving, ranging from beginner to advanced.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
- **SQL**: Solutions are written using SQL queries.
- **Pandas**: Some problems (from LeetCode) are solved using Pandas in Python, offering a flexible way to manipulate data.

## üìÇ Repository Structure
Each platform has its own directory, and inside each directory, you'll find:
- A folder with problem name
- A problem statement (where applicable).
- My solution in SQL and, in the case of LeetCode, an additional solution using Pandas.
